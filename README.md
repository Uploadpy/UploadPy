# MALICIOUS FILE UPLOADER MODULE
This is a malicious python library, DO NOT USE, this is FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY!

NOTE:
 1. As an educational piece, this script will attempt to do something bad.
 2. What it does exactly has been obfuscated in a simple manner, and with a bit of time you should be able to deduce it.
 3. Describing the exact process here will defeat part of the goal; not only is this intended to tell people to read code before they use it, it is also meant to offer an exercise in finding such an exploit in a piece of code that might look safe-ish at first glance.
